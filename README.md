# Codeforces-Solutions

This is a repo I created to store my solutions to problems on Codeforces and to document my growth in competitive programming.

# About Codeforces
Codeforces (https://codeforces.com/) is a popular competitive programming platform that hosts regular coding contests and provides a collection of problems that users can solve. It offers a challenging environment for programmers to improve their problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and efficiency.

By participating in Codeforces contests and solving problems, programmers can enhance their understanding of data structures and algorithms and improve their coding techniques.

# This Repo:
In this repository, I'll be storing my solutions to problems on Codeforces, documenting my progress, and showcasing my growth as a competitive programmer. Through my solutions, I aim to share my thought process, approaches, and optimizations with others interested in competitive programming.

I'll primarily be writing my solutions in Python but will slowly transition to C++ since it's a much faster language than Python.
